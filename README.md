# PRIMITIVE P2P

## HOW TO TEST

```
python start_chat.py
```

Will load a tracker server and a few clients.

Open each client's `chat.html` on each browser window. Example:

```
http://0.0.0.0:9000/chat.html
```

To send Direct messages, copy the IP AND PORT into the left field
and enter the message you want to send. MAKE SURE THE OTHER CLIENT
IS OPENED AS WELL.

---------

Use linux for best results (start_proxy will produce an error when using Windows)
