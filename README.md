# PRIMITIVE P2P

## HOW TO TEST

```
python start_chat.py
```

Will load a tracker server and a few clients.

Open each client's `chat.html` on each browser window. Example:

```
http://0.0.0.0:9000/chat.html
```

To send Direct messages, copy the IP AND PORT into the left field
and enter the message you want to send on the right field. 
MAKE SURE THE OTHER CLIENT IS OPENED AS WELL.

To broadcast message you must first connect to a peer.

---------

Use linux for best results (start_proxy will produce an error when using Windows)
